# the error interface

Challenge: 01-the-error-interface
Chapter: 06-errors

Go programs express errors with error values. An Error is any type that implements the simple built-in [error interface](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go):

```go
type error interface {
    Error() string
}

```

When something can go wrong in a function, that function should return an `error` as its last return value. Any code that calls a function that can return an `error` should handle errors by testing whether the error is `nil`.

## Atoi

Let's look at how the `strconv.Atoi` function uses this pattern. The function signature of `Atoi` is:
```go
func Atoi (s string) (int, error)
```

This means `Atoi` takes a string argument and returns two values: an integer and an `error`. If the string can be successfully converted to an integer, `Atoi` returns the integer and a `nil` error. If the conversion fails, it returns zero and a non-nil error.

Here's how you would safely use `Atoi`:
```go
// Atoi converts a stringified number to an integer
i, err := strconv.Atoi("42b")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("couldn't convert:", err)
    // because "42b" isn't a valid integer, we print:
    // couldn't convert: strconv.Atoi: parsing "42b": invalid syntax
    // Note:
    // 'parsing "42b": invalid syntax' is returned by the .Error() method
    return
}
// if we get here, then the
// variable i was converted successfully
```

a `nil` error denotes success; a non-nil error denotes a failure.

## Assignment

We offer a product that allows businesses to send pairs of messages to couples. It is mostly used by flower shops and movie theaters.

Complete the `sendSMSToCouple` function. It should send 2 messages, first to the customer and then to the customer's spouse.

1. - [ ] Use `SendSMS()` to send the `msgToCustomer`. If an error is encountered, return `0` and the error.
2. - [ ] Do the same for the `msgToSpouse`.
3. - [ ] If both messsages are sent successfully, return the total cost of the message added together.
