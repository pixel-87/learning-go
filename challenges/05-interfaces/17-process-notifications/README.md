# process notifications

Challenge: 17-process-notifications
Chapter: 05-interfaces

Textio now has a system to process different types of notifications: direct messages, group messages, and system alerts. Each notification type has a unique way of calculating its importance score based on user interaction and content.

## Assignment

1. - [ ] Implement the `importance` methods for each message type. They should return the importance score for each message type.
    1. - [ ] For a `directMessage` the importance score is based on if the message `isUrgent` or not. If it is urgent, then the importance score is `50` otherwise the importance score is equal to the DM's `priosityLevel`.
    2. - [ ] For a `groupMessage` the importance score is based on the message's `priorityLevel`.
    3. - [ ] All `systemAlert` messages should return a `100` importance score.
2. - [ ] Complete the `processNotification` function. It should identiy the type and return different values for each type.
    1. - [ ] For a `directMessage`, return the sender's username and importance score.
    2. - [ ] For a `groupMessage`, return the group's name and the importance score.
    3. - [ ] For a `systemAlert`, return the alert code and the importance score.
    4. - [ ] If the notification does not match any known type, return an empty string and a score of 0.
